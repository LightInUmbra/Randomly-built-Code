# OuiCareMemeCare
This is a small project that started from the idea of helping those in a bad state of mind, using the power of memes and the internet.
The purpose of this App is to guide the user to the appropriate memes for whatever feeling they are experiencing. In this case, it is
used to give a smile on someone's face and make them laugh and have a better day. This project was started by me and another person
while in a Local Hack Day event. It remains unfinished, but will return to this whenever I have free time. [WIP]
